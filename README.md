How to play

Before playing it is best that you use a pair of headphones.

Try to listen the beats that are positioned either left, right or center.

After the game plays the sound, you click on the matching position to score a point. If you pick wrong position or if your time is up, it is game over.

Since it is using Dolby API, it is can be played on Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari.
